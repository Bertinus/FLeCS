Flexible and Learnable Cell Simulator

## QuickStart

To install the conda environment, please run
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate flecs
pip install -e .
```

## Documentation

Please refer to the [flecs documentation](https://bertinus.github.io/FLeCS/) for details.


## Information to edit the documentation

We use mkdocs. More information is available on [how to get started](https://www.mkdocs.org/getting-started/) 
and how to [deploy the documentation](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/deploying-your-docs/).

The most important commands are:
- ```mkdocs serve```: starts a local server to preview your documentation.
- ```mkdocs build```
- ```mkdocs gh-deploy```: builds the docs, then commits and pushes them to the *gh-pages* branch of the repository.
